This project examines how growing polarization and fragmentation in the Wisconsin media ecology, as reflected in talk radio, local news, political advertising and social media, contributed to ideological and partisan political divides in the state. It will also study under what conditions the flow of information in the Wisconsin media ecology encourage citizens across the ideological spectrum to retrench into “echo chambers” that amplify highly partisan messages of party leaders and pundits within state politics. 
Responsibilities include database construction and maintenance, web scraping, statistical modelling, survey construction, data visualization, time series modelling, grant writing.
