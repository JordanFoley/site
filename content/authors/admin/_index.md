I am a doctoral candidate in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I also serve as the Assistant Director of the UW debate team.

My research interests are motivated by a desire to understand: (1) political information flows within and between media ecologies, (2) how messages are framed and processed by individuals and groups and, ultimately, (3) how these communication flows shape political belief systems, public opinion, and policy over time. My current research projects use survey data, computationally-assisted content coding of news and social media text, and thematic discourse analysis to understand the implications of these media ecologies concerning politically contentious topics ranging from [presidential debates](https://jordanfoley.net/files/papers/presidential_debates/performing_populism.pdf) to [mass shootings](https://jordanfoley.net/files/papers/mass_shootings/whose_lives_matter_mass_shootings_final.pdf). My dissertation, tentatively titled "Conspiratorial Media Ecologies: A Communicative Approach," extends this research agenda by interrogating the emergence, evolution, and uptake of conspiracy theories following mass shooting events in the United States.

I've been a debate coach and instructor for over a decade at the high school level and an intercollegiate coach for six years. After coaching high school national debate champions in 2010 and 2011, I became a full-time assistant coach at the University of Michigan before entering graduate school at Wake Forest University. Each summer, I work as an instructor and lecturer at the 7-week seniors program at the [University of Michigan National Debate Institutes](http://m.michigandebate.com/).
